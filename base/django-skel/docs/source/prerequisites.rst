Prerequisites
=============

Before we go any further, I'm going to assume that you've got the following
things:

* You're running some flavor of Linux or Mac (untested) as your desktop OS.
* You've got Django 1.4 installed somewhere (inside a virtualenv, preferably).
* You have an `Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ account. This is
  required if you want to use our production deployment tools. If you don't
  want to run your code in production, don't worry about it.
* You have a `Heroku <http://www.heroku.com/>`_ account. Heroku is the best
  python web host on the internet. If you'd like to deploy your site to
  production, having an account there will be extremely useful.
* You have the `Heroku toolbelt <https://toolbelt.heroku.com/>`_ installed.
  This only applies to you if you plan on deploying your stuff to production
  (same as the above).
